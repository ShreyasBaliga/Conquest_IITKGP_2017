# Conquest_IITKGP_2017
This is a project which takes a video input from an overhead camera and determines the best path to take based on the resources and the obstacles given for your bot to travel.
The code is made in accordance with the rules of IIT Kharagpur's Conquest competition held in 2017 during Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur's techno-management fest.
